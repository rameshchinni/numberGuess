The program picks a random number from 1 to 10. The user gets three guesses. As soon as the user enters the correct number the program writes a winning message and will display the 'Start new game' button.  If the user fails to enter the correct number in three guesses, the program writes a failure message with 'Start new game' button.


The program also writes, when first guess is wrong will display the "cold". If the second guess is wrong will display "warm", for the last guess is wrong will display the "hot".
